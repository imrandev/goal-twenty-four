    <string name="description">
        Arsenal was founded in 1886 in Woolwich and in 1893 became the first club from the south of
        England to join the Football League. In 1913, they moved north across the city to Arsenal
        Stadium in Highbury. In the 1930s, they won five League Championship titles and two FA Cups.
        After a lean period in the post-war years they won the League and FA Cup Double, in the
        1970–71 season, and in the 1990s and first decade of the 21st century, won two more Doubles
        and reached the 2006 UEFA Champions League Final. Since neighbouring Tottenham Hotspur,
        the two clubs have had a fierce rivalry, the North London derby.
